# Club

<p>This is a club management program. The main method (in ClubManager.java) takes four arguments (four .txt files), which comprise the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>members - data on a number of club members. A member needs at least a valid name and mobile to be added to the list of members</li>
  <li>instructions - instructions to perform on the list of members e.g. add or delete a member, sort member data, or run a query on fees by age or pass type</li>
  <li>result - output file to print a formatted member list to</li>
  <li>report - output file to print the results of any queries</li>
</ol>
<p> The data for each member from the members and instructions files is validated using a number of regular expressions for e.g. to check that a mobile number provided contains only digits and not letters.<p>
